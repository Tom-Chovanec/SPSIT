# Family

A family is a group of people who live together and share their experiences with each other. Families are most often somewhat blood related (parents with grandparents and children, siblings), but they can often also be adoptive/foster families or a group of close friends that live together. Growing up in a family will help children adapt to life and learn basic skills like communication, basic chores and duties, manners...

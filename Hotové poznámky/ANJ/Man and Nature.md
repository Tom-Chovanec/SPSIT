# Man and Nature

#### Overview
Nature is the material world that surrounds us - plants, forests, mountains, lakes, animals... However, all of these are being actively destroyed on a massive scale by companies. Deforestation removes habitat for many species; oil extraction kills sea animals and bird; and other means of pollution harm the ecosystem and make earth less livable for us and other species.

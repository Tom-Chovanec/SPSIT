# Fashion

#### Overview
Fashion is how people present themselves using clothes, hair, makeup and accessories. Fashion trends change depending on the place, religion, hobbies, age, wealth, formality, etc... It changes based on the climate and season - people in warmer climates will dress lighter, breathable clothes; and people in colder climates will wear clothes which isolate heat and cover skin. Certain activities have special clothes/uniforms, or are better performed while wearing certain types of clothes. If invited to an event, we should follow the given dress code (if any). The fashion industry often utilizes child labor for lower prices.
